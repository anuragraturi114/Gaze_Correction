## Features

- Real-time gaze correction from webcam feed
- Uses facial landmark detection to identify eye positions
- Adjusts gaze direction to maintain eye contact with the camera
- Supports various lighting conditions and poses

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- dlib
- NumPy

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy
